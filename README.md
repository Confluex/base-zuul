# DevNull.org Shared Code Repository

This *will be* a set of groovy APIs for re-use on my other personal projects. 

* devnull-parent: plugin and dependency managers, version info, bare-bones build and testing dependencies.
* devnull-orm: mainly there to provide spring-data-jpa config but I want to eventually groovy up the specification methods to take closures, etc.
* devnull-security: provides a domain model, dao and services to work with spring security. Currently focused on OpenID support.
* devnull-web-archetype: Provides a Spring MVC webapp with Groovy backend with Twitter Bootstrap UI
* devnull-web-sample: Mainly used to re-generate or diff against the archetype

More documentation to come (probably)
